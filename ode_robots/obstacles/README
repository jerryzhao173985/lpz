\dir obstacles

Obstacles in our simulations are different kinds of boundaries, so called arenas or playgrounds.
\ref lpzrobots::Playground is just a rectancular arena, \ref lpzrobots::ClosedPlayground one with a ceiling.
The \ref lpzrobots::OctaPlayground can have 8 corners but even more, because the number of corners is
adjustable, so you can even generate a circular arena.
Furthermore there is a class \ref lpzrobots::TerrainGround for using ppm files as ground in simulations (which is not working at the moment).

The \ref lpzrobots::Sphere is at the moment the only moveable (e.g. through collisions with moving vehicles) 
obstacle but all other bodies are also possible.
