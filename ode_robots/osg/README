\dir osg


The \a osg directory provides the osg primitves of which robots and obstacles are assembled
and further helpful things dealing with the visualization in OSG.

OSG stands for OpenSceneGraph and is an open source high peformance 3D graphics toolkit 
(http://www.openscenegraph.org). 
A documentation can be found on their webpage under documentation or by klicking the link
http://www.openscenegraph.org/osgwiki/pmwiki.php/Documentation/Documentation 

For now only the primitives should be explained, which are required to build new objects for the 
simulations:
- \ref lpzrobots::Plane Graphical plane (represented as a large thin box, because OSG does not draw planes)
- \ref lpzrobots::Box 
- \ref lpzrobots::Sphere
- \ref lpzrobots::Capsule (a cylinder with round ends
- \ref lpzrobots::Transform (embedding a primitive in another primitive)

The mentioned primitves are drivatives of \ref lpzrobots::Primitive which is an interface class 
for primitives represented in the physical and graphical world. 
It is intended to bring OSG and ODE together and hide most implementation details.


For visualization the primitves use the osgprimitives 
(since this is done in the primitives you don't have to bother about this one):
- \ref lpzrobots::OSGPlane Graphical plane (represented as a large thin box, because OSG does not draw planes)
- \ref lpzrobots::OSGBox 
- \ref lpzrobots::OSGSphere
- \ref lpzrobots::OSGCylinder
- \ref lpzrobots::OSGCapsule (a cylinder with round ends
- \ref lpzrobots::OSGMesh for graphical mesh or arbitrary OSG model

They are derived from \ref lpzrobots::OSGPrimitive which is an interface class 
for graphic primitives like spheres, boxes, and meshes, which can be drawn by OSG.
