\dir ode_robots/robots 

The robots of our simuated worlds "live" in this directory.
You find the class \ref AbstractRobot here, which provides the interface fulfilled
by all the robots (which are derived from this class).
There are two robots which are recommended as a first example:
 \ref lpzrobots::Nimm4  and \ref lpzrobots::Sphererobot3Masses. \n
Also the simulation template_sphererobot with
 ode_robots/simulations/template_sphererobot/main.cpp
 as a main function are really good commented 
 and therfore recommended as first example. 
You can easily find them by clicking 
 on the tab  "Examples" at the top of the page.
