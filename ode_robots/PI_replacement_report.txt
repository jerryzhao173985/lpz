PI to M_PI Replacement Report
=============================
Date: 2025-06-24

Summary:
--------
Successfully replaced all uses of the PI macro with M_PI in the ode_robots codebase.

Files Modified:
--------------
1. osg/cameramanipulator.cpp
   - Added #include <cmath>
   - Replaced 4 occurrences of PI with M_PI

2. osg/cameramanipulatorTV.cpp
   - Added #include <cmath>
   - Replaced 2 occurrences of PI with M_PI

3. osg/cameramanipulatorFollow.cpp
   - Added #include <cmath>
   - Replaced 2 occurrences of PI with M_PI

4. osg/cameramanipulatorRace.cpp
   - Added #include <cmath>
   - Replaced 2 occurrences of PI with M_PI

Total Replacements: 10 occurrences of PI replaced with M_PI

Changes Made:
------------
- All conversions from radians to degrees that used PI now use M_PI
- Added #include <cmath> to ensure M_PI is defined
- M_PI is the standard C++ constant defined in <cmath>

Backup:
-------
Original files backed up in: backup_20250624_120006/

Verification:
------------
No remaining uses of bare PI macro found in the codebase.
All modified files now properly include <cmath> for M_PI definition.

Next Steps:
----------
1. Compile the modified code to ensure no build errors
2. Run tests to verify functionality remains unchanged
3. Remove backup directory once verified: rm -rf backup_20250624_120006/
