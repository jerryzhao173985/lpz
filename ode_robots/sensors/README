\dir sensors

All sensors should be placed in this folder.
Up to now there is an abstract class for Ray-based sensors called \ref lpzrobots::RaySensor and
one child implementing an infrared sensor (\ref lpzrobots::IRSensor).

The \ref lpzrobots::RaySensorBank allows a common administration of a set of ray sensors.
