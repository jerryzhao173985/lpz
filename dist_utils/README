Two things can be done here:
create packages for debian and ubuntu: use the Makefile
 it contains all the voodoo to create packages, see below
create a binary executable bundle: use create_executable_dist.sh
  to add a simulation to the bundle use add_executeable_simulation.sh

To create Packages:
copy the Makefile somewhere on the computer where you want to create packages and type make for further help

You need the following packages:
sudo apt-get install debconf devscripts quilt docbook-to-man

#
# make sure your gpg-agent is running
# eval $(gpg-agent --daemon)
# ....
