lpzrobots installation hints. Please check also the online documentation
at http://robot.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/software

Install from source:
- Check Dependencies file and install all the packages mentioned there then
type
> make
this will first create a configuration file.
Anwser the following questions.
1) The installation path is usually /usr/local but
 can also be /Users/yourlogin or /home/yourlogin for an installation without root permissions for different machines.

2) The installation type:
  u) User installation means to install the simulator library and header files into the system, which are then supposed to be fixed
  d) If you plan to develop/change the simulator then you better go for this option.
  Only the utilities are installed on the system, but the libraries and header files are kept in the lpzrobots directory which is then you working directory with
  all the simulations and so on.

3) Are you sure? ;-) answer y want to proceed

Note that this choice will change all the makefiles of the simulations.
The user makefiles expect a system installation, i.e. that the libraries and include files are found by the compiler/linker in the usual places, whereas the development makefiles expect that the folder structure within the lpzrobots directory is as it is.

You can change you configuration by calling
> make conf
again.
