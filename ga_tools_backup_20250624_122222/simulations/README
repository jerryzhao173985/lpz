/**
\dir ga_tools/simulations

The simulations directory contains the different simulations originated from our work
on the evolutionary issue.

You can just go into one directory, type \p make and after successful compilation \p start
to start a simulation. For a faster run you should use make opt and start_opt -nographics as parameter.\n
For convenience you should start with one of the template directories like template_cycled_GA_Simulation.
The simulation file \ref ga_tools/simulations/template_cycled_GA_simulation/main.cpp "main.cpp"
 of the template_cycled_GA_Simulation simulation is really good
commented and therefore is recommended as first example. 
For creating your own simulation just type:\n
<tt> $> ./createNewSimulation.sh template_cycled_GA_Simulation my_sim</tt>\n
to create the directory \p my_sim, adapt it to your needs, run \p make and \p start and it should work.
