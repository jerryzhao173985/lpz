the OPCODE directory is covered by this license:
You’re free to use them in any commercial or non-commercial program.
Copyright  2001-2003 Pierre Terdiman

Another clause found in http://www.codercorner.com/OpcodeUserManual.pdf makes the license
DFSG free:
Q: Am I allowed to use OPCODE in a commercial program ?
A: Yes. The library is free. No GPL or LGPL, you can do whatever you want with the code. I
would appreciate it if you write somewhere in your product that you're using OPCODE, but
that's not mandatory. I would also appreciate a notification by mail, just to know how people
are using the lib.
