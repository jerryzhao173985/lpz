In this folder you can find a copy of the ODE (http://www.ode.org) 
 that works with our simulations. It is the 0.11.1 release.
 It is compiled to double precision by default and 
 renamed to ode-dbl to not cause problems with a single precision
 installation.

The recommended installation procedure is controlled from 
 the master Makefile in lpzrobots. Simply do
\code
make ode
make install_ode
\endcode
as it is also printed by the makefile itself.

Please refere also to the documentation in the opende directory.
