You need qt-4 develeopment packages with qt3support installed
Call:

qmake guilogger.pro
make

the binary is then in src/bin/
copy this to your bin path (e.g. /usr/local/bin or ~/bin)
Check the README or the online documentation on 
 http://robot.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/software 
for the data/file format and other information.
A typical call is

youprog | guilogger

or to open the guilogger directly from your program. 
You can open an existing data file with

guilogger -m file -f file.log

Have fun!
