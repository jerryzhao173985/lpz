\dir wirings

The wirings directory contains some implementation of the  class \ref AbstractWiring interface. 
The wiring specifies the connections between the sensor values of the robot
and the sensor values of the controller, 
and the connections between the motor outputs of the controller 
and the motor values given to the robot. In the most simple case you just
put the values through the wiring without changing them like in \ref One2OneWiring.
But the controller can also get more sensor values than the robot has. For example you
can feed the derivatives of the sensor values in the controller as it is done in \ref DerivativeWiring. Further useful wirings are \ref SelectiveOne2OneWiring and \ref WiringSequence.
Of course you can also implement your own wiring.
