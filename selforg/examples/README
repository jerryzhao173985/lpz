\dir selforg/examples
Examples for the usage of the selforg framework. 
You have two options for the usage of the controllers and the framwork.
It depends on what you want and what you have. 
You can either use a controller just as it is (see example directconnect), 
 or use it in the framework of controller and wiring and agent (see example integration).
The first version means that you have the direct control of the data flow.
The latter has the advantage to faciliates you with the plotting options and such like.
Here the data flow is controlled by the agent, which then asks the robot about the sensors,
 invokes the controller and sends the motor values the robot again.

/**
\example directconnect/directconnect.cpp 
 A simple example for the usage of the controller without the framework.
 This version means that you have the direct control of the data flow.
 See also \ref selforg
*/

/**
\example integration/main.cpp 
 A simple example for the integration of a robot into the framework (with agent, controller, wiring). 
 This facilitates you with the plotting options, tracing and such like.
Here the data flow is controlled by the agent, which then asks the robot about the sensors,
 invokes the controller and sends the motor values the robot again.
 See also \ref selforg.
*/

/**
\example wiredconnect/main.cpp 
 An example for the usage of the controller with the framework, but without 
 the robot and agent representation.
 This version means that you have still the direct control of the data flow
 but you can already use the logging and plotting facilities.
