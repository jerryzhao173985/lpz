\dir selforg/controller 

The controller directory contains (as you can guess) the controllers 
developed in the robotic group of Leipzig University. For the approach, 
general remarks, aims and papers see http://robot.informatik.uni-leipzig.de

The common interface is provided in class \ref AbstractController , 
which inherits methods for configuration and disposal of internal 
parameter as well as serialization from the classes \ref Configurable, \ref Inspectable and \ref Storeable.
Each controller realizes this interface to ensure collaboration.

For easy use in the beginning use \ref Sos and look at the examples
in the \ref selforg/examples  directory.
You can also start with a copy of one of the templates in the \ref lpzrobots/ode_robots/simulations directory and you can see how things work.
