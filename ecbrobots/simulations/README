/**
\dir ecbrobots/simulations

The simulations directory contains the different ECBManager originated from our work
on the selforganization issue. For example there exists in the directory \ref ecbrobots/simulations/sphererobot "ecbrobots/simulations/sphererobot"
the ECBManager for controlling the SphericalRobot.

You can just go into one directory, type \p make and after successful compilation \p start
to start a ECBManager. \n
For convenience you should start with one of the template directories like template_ecbrobot.
Both the ECBManager file \ref ode_robots/simulations/template_sphererobot/main.cpp "main.cpp"
of the SphericalRobot-ECBManager and ECB definitions in  \ref ecb.cpp are really good
commented and therfore recommended as first example. You can easy find them by clicking
on the tab  "Examples" at the top of the page.\n
For creating your own ECBManager just type:\n
<tt> $> ./createNewSimulation.sh template_sphererobot my_sim</tt>\n
to create the directory \p my_sim, adapt it to your needs, run \p make and \p start and it should work.
